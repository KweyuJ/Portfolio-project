    <h2 class="skills">ABOUT ME...</h2>
    <p class="paragraph1">Aside from software development I'm an incoming 5th year medical student at The University of Nairobi. After spending approximately 5years in medical school
        I chose programming because my dream is to find a way to integrate technology and medicine in specific fields when I become
        a medical doctor.Apart from school I enjoy cooking and listening to good music especially when I'm hanging out with my friends.
